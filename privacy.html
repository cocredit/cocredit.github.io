                our products or services, make a card payment or transfer

                It is not mandatory for you to provide us with the personal

                2.3 Information we collect from others
              </h4>
              <p>
                We collect information about you from others such as service
                providers, agents, your bank, advisers, aggregators, brokers,
                employers or family members. For example, if you apply for
                credit, we may need to obtain a credit report from a credit
                reporting body. We will also obtain bank account information
                from your bank throughout the term of the loan, and
                commission-related data from aggregators. We may collect
                information about you that is publicly available, for example,
                from public registers or social media, or made available by
                third parties.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you elect to use bank statements and third-party account
                aggregation service providers in connection with our
                assessment of your application, you permit such third-party
                services to access your banking transaction data or
                commission-related data linked to the online credentials you
                provide. The third-party service provider will access your
                personal information for the purpose of providing this
                personal and business bank account data to us.
              </p>
              <p>
                The third-party service provider may access transactional data
                from any account that is associated with the login credentials
                that you submit. This may include personal accounts as well as
                business accounts and commission-related accounts. Your
                provision of banking and other login credentials to utilise
                such third-party service providers does not provide us with
                your login credentials or passwords or the ability to access
                your internet banking or other web-related service (other than
                as stated above).
              </p>
              <p>
                Through the use of such third-party service providers, we will
                obtain up to the last twenty-four (24) months bank and
                commission transactions on the date you apply for a loan, in
                addition to further ongoing bank and/or commission
                transactions for the term of the facility, for the purpose of
                assessing any future facility applications, continuing to
                offer you our facility, or making a future offer to you. We
                note that your third-party suppliers’ terms (including bank's
                terms) may prohibit you from sharing your login, so you agree
                to appoint our third-party service provider as your agent to
                access your internet banking on your behalf solely for this
                purpose and you consent to our ongoing access to this
                information for the term of the loan and the purposes outlined
                above.
              </p>
              <p>
                Should you agree to the use of such a third-party service
                provider, you will be subject to their terms and conditions
                and privacy policy which will govern any act or omission of
                that third-party service provider in connection with your use
                of that service.

                health information that’s collected on hardship applications.
                If we need to obtain this type of information, we will ask for

                primarily from you (or from someone who is representing or
                assisting you). However, there are certain instances in which
                we will collect information about you from third parties where
                it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect it directly
                from you. For example, even where your application is for
                credit, we may collect information about you from a business

              <p>
                Improvements in technology enable organisations to collect and
                use information to get a more integrated view of customers and
                provide better products and services. We may combine our

                variety of external sources (for example, census or Bureau of
                Statistics data). We are able to analyse the data in order to
                gain useful insights which can be used for any of the purposes

              <p>
                Generally, we use customer service teams located within
                Australia. However, we may send your information overseas,
                including to overseas Group members and to service providers
                or other third parties who operate or hold data outside
                Australia. Where we do this, we take reasonable steps to
                ensure that appropriate data handling and security
                arrangements are in place. Please note that Australian law may
                not apply to some of these entities and the relevant entity
                may not be required to protect the information in a way that,
                overall, provides comparable safeguards to those in the
                Australian Privacy Act (as applicable).
              </p>
              <p>
                We may also send information overseas to complete a particular
                transaction or where this is required by laws and regulations
                of Australia or another country.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where we send your information overseas, it is likely to be
                one of the following countries:
              </p>
              <ul>

              <p>
                Where we send your information to overseas Group members or
                service providers, we take reasonable steps to ensure that

              <p>
                When you apply to us for credit or propose to be a guarantor,
                we need to know if you’re able to meet repayments under your
                agreement with us. We also want to avoid giving you further
                credit if this would put you in financial difficulty. One of
                our checks involves obtaining a credit report about you.
              </p>

              <h4 class="zubuz-small-mb">5.1 Credit reports</h4>
              <p>
                A credit report contains information about your credit history
                that helps credit providers assess your credit applications,
                verify your identity and manage accounts you hold with them.
                Credit reporting bodies collect and share this information
                with credit providers like us and other service providers such
                as phone companies.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Privacy Act and Credit Reporting Privacy Code limit the
                information that credit providers can disclose about you to
                credit reporting bodies, as well as the ways in which credit
                providers can use credit reports.

                <li>how many accounts you’ve had or currently have;</li>
                <li>
                  whether or not you’ve met your loan repayment obligations;

                overall assessment score of your creditworthiness and other
                comprehensive credit information as necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                The credit reporting bodies we use will hold your personal

                We use information from credit reporting bodies to confirm
                your identity, assess applications for credit, manage our
                relationship with you and collect overdue payments. We also
                use this information as part of arriving at our own internal
                assessment of your creditworthiness.
              </p>
              <p>
                We store credit-related information with your other

              <p>
                Credit providers may ask credit-reporting bodies to use their
                credit-related information to pre-screen you for direct
                marketing. You can ask a credit reporting body not to do this.
                Also, if you’ve been, or have reason to believe that you’re
                likely to become, a victim of fraud (including identity
                fraud), you can ask the credit reporting body not to use or
                disclose the credit-related information it holds about you.

                In certain circumstances we’re allowed to deny your request,
                or limit the access we provide. For example, we might not
                provide you access to commercially sensitive information.

              <p>
                You can ask us to correct any inaccurate information we hold
                or have provided to others (including credit-related
                information) by contacting us. If the information that is
                corrected is information we have provided to others, you can
                ask us to notify them of the correction. We don’t charge a fee
                for these requests.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your request relates to credit-related information provided
                by others, we may need to consult with credit reporting bodies
                or other credit providers. We’ll try to correct information
                within 30 days. If we can’t complete the request within 30
                days, we’ll let you know the reason for the delay within 20
                days and try to agree on a timeframe with you to extend the
                period.

              <p>
                If we’re able to correct your information, we’ll inform you
                when the process is complete.

              <p>
                If we disagree with you that information should be corrected,

                include a statement with the relevant information, indicating
                your view that the information is inaccurate, misleading,
